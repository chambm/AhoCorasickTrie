Description: Aho-Corasick is an optimal algorithm for finding many
    keywords in a text. It can locate all matches in a text in O(N+M) time; i.e.,
    the time needed scales linearly with the number of keywords (N) and the size of
    the text (M). Compare this to the naive approach which takes O(N*M) time to loop
    through each pattern and scan for it in the text. This implementation builds the
    trie (the generic name of the data structure) and runs the search in a single
    function call. If you want to search multiple texts with the same trie, the
    function will take a list or vector of texts and return a list of matches to
    each text. By default, all 128 ASCII characters are allowed in both the keywords
    and the text. A more efficient trie is possible if the alphabet size can be
    reduced. For example, DNA sequences use at most 19 distinct characters and
    usually only 4; protein sequences use at most 26 distinct characters and usually
    only 20. UTF-8 (Unicode) matching is not currently supported.
